Outfit Recommender using ResNET50
Overview
This project is an Outfit Recommender system that utilizes deep learning techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) and collaborative filtering, to provide personalized recommendations for users. The system integrates various deep learning models, including ResNET50, CNNs, and RNNs, to analyze text descriptions of clothing items, extract features from images, and process sequential data to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Features
•	Deep Learning Integration: The system combines NLP, collaborative filtering, CNNs, and RNNs to create a comprehensive recommendation engine.
•	Text Analysis with NLP: Utilizes NLP techniques to analyze text descriptions of clothing items, extracting relevant features for recommendation.
•	Collaborative Filtering: Implements collaborative filtering methods to generate user-item recommendations based on user preferences and similarities.
•	Feature Extraction with CNNs: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically ResNET50, for image feature extraction, enabling the system to understand the visual aspects of clothing items.
•	Sequential Data Processing with RNNs: Incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process sequential data, enhancing the system's ability to handle time-series data and improve recommendation accuracy
